# Playwright Demo

This is a demo project to showcase end-to-end testing using Playwright. The tests are organized into different test scenarios, such as login, sign-up, purchase, and cart functionalities. The test reports are automatically generated and displayed via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- End-to-end tests using Playwright for various user interactions (login, sign-up, purchasing, and cart).
- Reports generated using GitHub Actions.
- Detailed test execution reports available on GitHub Pages.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janahbeatriz/playwright-demo.git
   cd playwright-demo


## Viewing Results from GitHub

After pushing the tests to GitHub and running them via GitHub Actions, the results are automatically displayed on a **GitHub Pages** site. You can view the detailed test execution reports at the following URL:

[Playwright Test Reports](https://janahbeatriz.github.io/playwright-demo/)

This report includes visual feedback of test execution, including:

- Success/failure status for each test.
- Detailed logs and output.
- Information on each step of the tests (including timing and test details).

The GitHub Pages site automatically updates after each test run triggered by a push to the repository or a pull request.
