## Viewing Results from GitHub

After pushing the tests to GitHub and running them via GitHub Actions, the results are automatically displayed on a **GitHub Pages** site. You can view the detailed test execution reports at the following URL:

[Playwright Test Reports](https://janahbeatriz.github.io/playwright-demo/)

This report includes visual feedback of test execution, including:

- Success/failure status for each test.
- Detailed logs and output.
- Information on each step of the tests (including timing and test details).

The GitHub Pages site automatically updates after each test run triggered by a push to the repository or a pull request.
